## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS 
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This was my first Frontend mentor project that i created (my second project using HTML and CSS altogether), i struggled very much with the positioning of the elements, but i learned a lot from this project. I learned how to use flexbox and grid, and i learned how to use the dev tools to see what is going on with the elements.
I watched a lot of tutorials on how to do what and took a lot of notes, and i think i will be able to do better next time.
I would like to specially thank to Kevin Powell, he is a great teacher and i learned a lot from him. The same should be said about Dave Gray, he is also a great teacher and i learned a lot from him too. (their youtube channels are: [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) and[Dave Gray](https://www.youtube.com/@DaveGrayTeachesCode))

### Continued development

In the future i would like to learn more about flexbox and grid, and i would like to improve my css skills. I think i will give a try to this project again in the following months, and i will try to do it better than the first time. Mainly thinking about adding new features to the project.
